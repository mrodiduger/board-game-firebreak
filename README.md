Firebreak game is a turn-based board game, in which 4 players try to extinguish a fire, spread by wind in every round.  There are different types of cells on the board, which are effected from fire differently. Players can buy fire engines and fill their water thanks in their turn according to an action point dynamic. Game finishes when there is no cell left to burn (lose) or when the fire is completely extinguished.
